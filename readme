Example of using Adobe AIR Native Extension to display a native android window over AIR app.

This example borrows heavily from:
https://github.com/mr-archano/Android-AIR-Extensions
Those examples really clarified a lot for me.

what this extension adds is:
- the ability to show a native window
- callback intent from native window to ANE
- callback event from ANE to flash

what it removes are all other functions, to make the example more clear.
I only left the toast functionality in, just to show how the extension would work with multiple functions.
