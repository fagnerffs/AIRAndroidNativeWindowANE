This project shows AndroidExtensions in action. I assume you are familiar with Flex Mobile development and with using Flash Builder. Unfortunately the current version of Flash Builder (4.5.1) doesn't provide a integrated build system for native extensions. For this purpose an ANT script has been provided to successfully build and deploy this project on your device.

*Requirements:*
* "Flash Builder (4.5.1 atm)":http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-builder-family.html
* "Flex 4.5.1 SDK patched against AIR 3.0 SDK":http://www.francescoflorio.info/?p=157
* "Android SDK":http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

*How to build:*
In order to build successfully this project you need to:
* edit build.properties in build/ folder accordingly to your system/resources
* make sure the project compiles against AIR 3.0 patched Flex SDK
* run build.xml ANT script from build/ folder

*NOTE:* build.xml provides different targets. The default one (deploy_apk) is intended to allow you easily build and deploy the final .apk using the extensions binaries provided (lib/AndroidExtensions.swc and ext/AndroidExtensions.ane).
BTW you can download the companion Android and Flex Library projects, and build extension binaries on your own, running the proper targets defined into ANT build script.
