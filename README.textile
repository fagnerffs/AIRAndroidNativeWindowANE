Actually you can find three simple-but-useful little extensions, which allow to use Android native facilities for:

* sharing content
* send SMS
* show a Toast message

All you have to do in order to see them in action is to grab the "AndroidExtensions_Demo":https://github.com/mr-archano/Android-AIR-Extensions/tree/master/AndroidExtensions_Demo Flex Mobile Project, follow the build instructions provided in "README.textile":https://github.com/mr-archano/Android-AIR-Extensions/blob/master/AndroidExtensions_Demo/README.textile andâ€¦ enjoy!

This repository contains the projects needed in order to build and use some cool AIR Native Extension written by my own for Android platform.

* *AndroidExtensions:* the Flex Library project containing the ActionScript side of ANE

* *AndroidExtensions_Demo:* a simple Flex Mobile (for Android) project showing AndroidExtensions in action

* *AndroidExtensions_Native:* the Java project containing the native Android code exposed to AIR runtime via ANE facilities
